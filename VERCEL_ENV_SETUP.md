   - Add:
     - **Name**: `VITE_API_URL`
     - **Value**: `https://to-do-list-backend-04i3.onrender.com`
     - **Environments**: Check all (Production, Preview, Development)

3. **Redeploy**
   - Go to **Deployments** tab
   - Click the **3 dots** on latest deployment
   - Click **Redeploy**

### That's it!
